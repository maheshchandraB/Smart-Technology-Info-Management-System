    <p> The modern combine harvester, or simply combine, is a versatile machine designed to efficiently harvest a variety of grain crops. 
        The name derives from its combining four separate harvesting operations—reaping, threshing, gathering, and winnowing—into a single process. 
        Among the crops harvested with a combine are wheat, rice, oats, rye, barley, corn (maize), sorghum, soybeans, flax (linseed), sunflowers and rapeseed. 
        The separated straw, left lying on the field, comprises the stems and any remaining leaves of the crop with limited nutrients left in it: the straw is 
        then either chopped, spread on the field and ploughed back in or baled for bedding and limited-feed for livestock.
        Combine harvesters are one of the most economically important labour-saving inventions, significantly reducing the fraction of the population engaged in agriculture.

        The combine, short for combine harvester, is an essential and complex machine designed for efficient harvesting of mass quantities of grain. Modern combines can cut a swath through a field more than 40 feet wide.

The name comes from combining three essential harvest functions – reaping, threshing and winnowing. Corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, rye, barley, sorghum, flax, sunflowers and canola can all be harvested with a head designed for that particular grain.

Hiram Moore patented the first U.S. combine in 1935. Early versions were horse-drawn, followed by models that were pulled behind a tractor. The mid-twentieth century saw the introduction of the self-propelled combine, and by the 1980s they began to come equipped with on-board electronics to measure operation and yield data.

Here you will find more information on how to select the right machine for your farm, and the best maintenance and operating practices to get the most from the combine when it’s time to harvest.

COMBINES KEEP GETTING BETTER
Safe and efficient grain harvesting depends on choosing the right combine harvester for the job. Equipment manufacturers, including John Deere, AGCO, Case IH, New Holland, and Claas, continue to advance technology and design to meet farmers’ needs. New models offer grain tanks as large as 485-bushels with unloading speeds of 6 bushels per second. New apps allow farmers to remotely monitor combine performance. Self-propelled combines were invented to use less fuel than those pulled behind a tractor, and new models continue that trend, with features that improve traction, driver response, and in some cases offer a special gear for road travel.

USED COMBINES ARE BEST FOR SOME FARMS
For some, the cost of a new combine may be prohibitive. Luckily, used machines are available. Coming off a string of lean sales years, machinery dealers are ready to bargain, and combines can be one of the best buys around.

The specific features of any model will determine its value when new and when used. Rigid auger headers depreciate their value faster than the newer flexing draper headers, and the machinery brand can make a difference. Buyers should discuss the combine’s past use with the dealer as replacement of belts and other parts can get expensive.
